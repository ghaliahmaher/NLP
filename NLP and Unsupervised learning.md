# **NLP and Unsupervised learning**

With the increase in population density in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia especially in Riyadh city, which is considered the capital of Saudi, and the largest city in Saudi Arabia in terms of the area, also the fastest expanding cities in the world.

For all these reasons, the crowdedness increases, especially in the morning and evening peak times.

One of the problems that faces the city is improper parking which considers the most common cause of traffic congestion and disruption, not only in Riyadh but in the whole Kingdom. Therefore, this behavior is considered a traffic violation in the Saudi Traffic Law, It's called an “Illegal parking violation”. 

Our goal in this project is to serve The General Saudi Department of Traffic and the citizens by building a chatbot that can answer all the questions, receive the inquiries and objections that are being asked by the citizens.

For more explanation, this project is based primarily on Natural Language Processing NLP. The concept is about analyzing the text sent by the end-user (Input), then the model will find the best answer to replay within an active human-based conversation (Output).

The model used is BERT_for_Arabic_Topic_Modeling_ACLing2021, which is a pre-trained model that uses the Arabic language. 
this model divides the data into topics, which we are concerned about, in answering the user with the correct answer based on the input from the user.

the tools are:
1. google colab environment.
1. BERT_for_Arabic_Topic_Modeling_ACLing2021 model.
1. cleaning the text using camel_tools, Farasah.

These are the results:

However, the project is not yet complete, we want to connect it to a database and a GUI. 

Thank you.
